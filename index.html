        <h1>Croissant 🥐</h1>
        <p>
          A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired
          by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
          yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
          historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled
          and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
          in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
          flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have
          been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly
          since antiquity but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a
          staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
          croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
          replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
          laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made,
          frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that
          could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery,
          notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
          American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants
          sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
          Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many
          European countries.
